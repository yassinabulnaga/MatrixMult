The issue is that all banks are receiving the same data. This suggests the
unpacked array assignments might not be synthesizing correctly.

In pe_controller.sv STORE state, try this explicit version:

CURRENT (May not synthesize correctly):
```systemverilog
STORE: begin
    bram_c_en[row_cnt] = 1'b1;
    bram_c_we[row_cnt] = 1'b1;
    bram_c_addr[row_cnt] = col_cnt[BRAM_AW-1:0];
    bram_c_wdata[row_cnt] = acc_mat[row_cnt][col_cnt];
end
```

TRY THIS (Explicit loop):
```systemverilog
STORE: begin
    for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) begin
        if (i == row_cnt) begin
            bram_c_en[i] = 1'b1;
            bram_c_we[i] = 1'b1;
            bram_c_addr[i] = col_cnt[BRAM_AW-1:0];
            bram_c_wdata[i] = acc_mat[row_cnt][col_cnt];
        end else begin
            bram_c_en[i] = 1'b0;
            bram_c_we[i] = 1'b0;
            bram_c_addr[i] = '0;
            bram_c_wdata[i] = '0;
        end
    end
end
```

This explicitly sets ALL banks on every cycle, which should synthesize correctly.
